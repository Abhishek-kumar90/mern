# MERN Stack Project

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The frontend and backend are structured as separate directories within the same repository.

## Project Overview
This application allows users to manage transactions and view related statistics and charts. It features:
- A **React** frontend to display transaction data, statistics, and charts.
- A **Node.js/Express** backend that serves the data and handles API requests.
- **MongoDB** as the database to store transaction data.

## Folder Structure
The project structure is as follows:
my-project/ ├── backend/ # Backend API and server files │ ├── server.js # Express server entry point │ ├── models/ # MongoDB models │ └── (other backend files) ├── frontend/ # React frontend files │ ├── package.json # Frontend dependencies and scripts │ ├── src/ # Source files for React components │ └── (other frontend files) ├── .gitignore # Ignored files and directories ├── README.md # This README file └── (optional package.json) # Optional root-level package.json

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is a React application that communicates with the backend to fetch and display data.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
Install the frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Backend Setup
The backend is built with Express.js and connects to MongoDB to serve data via API routes.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14 or later)
MongoDB (either locally or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
Installation
Navigate to the backend/ directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure your .env file with MongoDB connection string (for local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas):

makefile
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The server will be available at http://localhost:5001.

Running the Project
To run both the frontend and backend simultaneously, you can follow these steps:

Start the Backend:
Run the backend server using node server.js.
Start the Frontend:
In the frontend/ directory, run npm start to start the React development server.
API Proxy:
The frontend will automatically proxy API requests to the backend server running on http://localhost:5001 (configured in the frontend package.json).
Dependencies
Frontend:
react - React framework for building user interfaces.
axios - Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
react-bootstrap - Bootstrap components for React.
Backend:
express - Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and server.
mongoose - MongoDB ODM to interact with MongoDB.
cors - Middleware to handle cross-origin requests.
dotenv - To manage environment variables.
Development Dependencies:
concurrently (optional) - To run both frontend and backend servers simultaneously.
License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

Note:
Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running for the application to work as expected. For the frontend, ensure that the correct API endpoints are being hit based on the server configuration.

For any additional setup or changes, please refer to the individual documentation for React and Express.
